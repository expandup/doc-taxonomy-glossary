                <h2>Installation by WordPress</h2>
                <p>After downloading your package, please refrain from loading the entire package before extracting the file. The package is in ZIP format, and you can use an application or program for unpacking it (such as 7zip, WinRAR, WinZip, or others).</p>
                <p>Once you've extracted the file, navigate to the resulting folder and look for a subfolder named 'plugin.' Inside this folder, you will find a file with the same name as the plugin you intend to install. This file is also in ZIP format and needs to be installed on your WordPress site.</p>
                <p>To complete the installation, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Log in to your WordPress website.</li>
                    <li>Go to the 'Plugins' page in the WordPress Admin Panel.</li>
                    <li>Select 'Add New Plugin.'</li>
                    <li>On the plugin upload page, click on the 'Upload Plugin' button (or a similar option depending on your WordPress version).</li>
                    <li>Browse for and select the ZIP file of the plugin you previously extracted.</li>
                    <li>Click 'Install Now' and follow the instructions to activate the plugin on your WordPress site.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Please remember that plugin installation is a crucial step in managing your website, so follow these instructions carefully to ensure a successful integration.</p>
            
                <h2>Installation by FTP</h2>
                <p><strong>Step 1: Preparation</strong></p>
                <p>Before you begin, make sure you have the ZIP file of the plugin you want to install on hand and unzipped. You will also need an FTP client such as FileZilla.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 2: Connect to Your Server via FTP</strong></p>
                <p>Start the FTP client (for example, FileZilla). Connect to your WordPress site's server using your FTP credentials (you'll usually find this information in your hosting provider's control panel).</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 3: Navigate to the Plugins Folder</strong></p>
                <p>After connecting successfully, you will see a folder structure of your website on the right side of the FTP client. Navigate to the folder where WordPress is installed. This is usually done by going to the "public_html" folder or your website's root directory. Inside that folder, find the subfolder called "wp-content" and click to open it.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 4: Find the Plugins Folder</strong></p>
                <p>Inside the "wp-content" folder, you'll find a folder called "plugins." Click to access it.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 5: Upload the Plugin via FTP</strong></p>
                <p>On the left side of the FTP client, navigate to the folder where you unzipped the plugin file on your computer. Select all files and folders from the unzipped plugin. Drag these files and folders to the "plugins" folder in the FTP client (right side).</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 6: Activate the Plugin in WordPress</strong></p>
                <p>After the files have been successfully transferred, access your WordPress site's admin panel. Go to the "Plugins" section in the menu. You should see the plugin you just downloaded listed among the available plugins. Click "Activate" under the plugin name.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 7: Configure the Plugin</strong></p>

                <p>The general settings are the starting point for customizing your plugin. Here you can configure the color style for your glossary and make some other adjustments. Overall, the setup is very simple.</p>
                <p>Two items deserve your special attention in this section. The first is the option to activate or deactivate the plugin, and the second point is the terms configuration. Terms are items created by you and are targets in your database, they can have public urls or not, and when clicked you can choose whether to redirect to the term's url or open related content in a popup. As illustrated in the image below:</p>

                <h2>License activation</h2>  
                <p>If you are having trouble accessing the configuration options of your plugin or if it has stopped working, displaying messages like "Please activate the plugin license to access all features" in the administrative area of your WordPress, it means that you need to activate the plugin license.</p>
                <p>Attention: The following procedure applies to all our plugins. To activate the plugin license, follow the steps below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Access your account page on the ExpandUP website and go to the "Application Password" tab. Create a password and store it securely, as it will be displayed only once. If you lose it, you will need to generate a new password for future activations.</p>
